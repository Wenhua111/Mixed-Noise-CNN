The codes for removing mixed noise using small CNN. The codes are implementation of the paper:

Islam, M. T., Rahman, S. M., Ahmad, M. O., & Swamy, M. N. S. (2018). Mixed Gaussian-impulse noise reduction from images using convolutional neural network. Signal Processing: Image Communication.

Consider citing the paper if you find the codes useful.

In order to run the example you have to install numpy and tensorflow.

Instrucitons:

1. First run CAI.m to create Cai's method processed file.
2. Then run test_cnn.py to perform the denoising process.
